### Step 3: Update Chatbot URLs

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If chatbot doesn't load in iframe:

- Try accessing the Streamlit URL directly

### If website doesn't deploy:

- Check Netlify build logs
- Verify `netlify.toml` configuration

### If iframe shows localhost:
- Run the `update_urls.py` script with correct Streamlit URL
- Commit and push changes
- Wait for Netlify to redeploy
